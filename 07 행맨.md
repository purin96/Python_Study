## Step 1

```
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.

import random
chosen_word= random.choice(word_list)

#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

guess= input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.

for letter in chosen_word:
 if letter==guess:
   print("Right")
 else:
   print("Wrong")
   
```
