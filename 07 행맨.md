## Step 1 무작위의 단어를 고르고 정답 확인하기

```
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.

import random
chosen_word= random.choice(word_list)

#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

guess= input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.

for letter in chosen_word:
 if letter==guess:
   print("Right")
 else:
   print("Wrong")
   
```

```
#Step 2

import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.

display=[]
for letter in range(len(chosen_word)):
  display.append("_")
print(display)
guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].

for letter in range(len(chosen_word)):
  if chosen_word[letter]==guess:
   display[letter]=guess

#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.
    
print(display)

## Step 3 플레이어가 이겼는지 확인하는 법

```
#Step 3

import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
word_length = len(chosen_word)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#Create blanks
display = []
for letter in range(len(chosen_word)):
  display.append("_")
print(display)

#TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.

end_of_game = False
while not end_of_game:
  guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()


# Check guessed letter
  for position in range(word_length):
      letter = chosen_word[position]
      print(f"Current position: {position}\n Current letter: {letter}\n Guessed letter: {guess}")
      if letter == guess:
          display[position] = letter
      
  print(display)
    
  if "_" not in display:
   end_of_game=True
